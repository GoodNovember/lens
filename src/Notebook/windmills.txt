We'll have an economy based on wind.

I never understood wind; you know, I know windmills very much.

I've studied it better than anybody, I know it's very expensive.

They're made in China and Germany mostly. Very few made here, almost none.

But, they're manufactured...

Tremendus. (if you're into this.) 

Tremendus fumes, gasses, are spewing into the atmosphere.

You know, we have a world right?

So, the world is tiny compared to the universe.

So, Tremendus, Tremendus ammount of fummes and everything.

You talk about the Carbon Footprint!

Fumes are spewing into the air, right? Spewing.

Whether it's in China, germany, it's going into the air.

It's our air, their air, everything, right?

So, they make these things. 

And then they put them up.

And, if you own a house within vision of some of these monsters your house is worth 50% of the price.

They're noisy.

They kill the birds.

You want to see a bird graveyard? You just go, take a look. A bird graveyard?

Go under a windmill some day.

You'll see more birds than you've ever seen ever in your life.

You know, in california, they were killing the bald eagle.

If you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for ten years.

A windmill will kill many bald eagles. It's true.

And you know what?

After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. 

That's true by the way, this is...

They make you turn it off after you've...

And yet if you've killed one, they put you in jail. That's okay.

But, why is it okay for these windmills to destroy the bird population and that's what they're doing.
