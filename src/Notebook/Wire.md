# A notebook focused on wires.

## Set lengths of wire vs. elastic wire.

I found a website that listed 10 sizes of wire. Here is the complete list of lenths they used:

- 1 foot
- 2 feet
- 3 feet
- 5 feet
- 7 feet
- 10 feet
- 14 feet
- 25 feet
- 50 feet
- 100 feet

They also had 8 colors:

- Gray
- Red
- Blue
- Black
- White
- Green
- Orange
- Yellow

What if the distances between components were read and the wire color and length was chosen automatically.
color could be tied to the length of wire and a switch between them should be a vibrant and obvious change.

The other idea of elastic wire is appealing as we could always have the best wire. smooth transitions between colors could arise.

The only issue that might arrise is that wires may not dangle if they are elastic. and I like a dangling wire.
